  <p>Simulation of the Ising model.  You can choose between two update methods -
metropolis and Wolff algorithm.  Several measurements are stored while running
including the current energy and magnetization, their averages, and their
variances.  The current value of each can be found at the top of the right
panel.  A graph of one value versus time can be directly below that.  The
particular variable can be changed via the 'Graph type' dropdown box.  These
measurements can be reset at any time by pressing 'Reset data'.  The 'Reset'
button restarts the simulation at infinite temperature (implies 'Reset
data').</p>

<p>The measurements as a time series as well as the graph and actual lattice
can be downloaded via the buttons on the button.</p>

<p>The other parameters can be set by the sliders or by clicking on the number
to the right of the slider, typing in a number, and pressing enter.  They are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Temperature - typical temperature, critical is around T_c = 2.26918531421</li>
    <li>Field - external magnetic field, H</li>
    <li>Sweep skip - the simulation can be graphics limited, this determines the
    number of sweeps between drawing</li>
    <li>Lattice size - grid size on a side, height = width</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: the graph can slow down the simulation at long times.  To speed up
simulation, select 'none' for 'Graph type'.  Data is still being collected.</p>
